Our themes are downloaded over 200,000 in less than one year and hopefully, we can double this number by end of 2014 (hopefully we will remember to update this number when the time comes).</code>

            <code className="text-light mb-5">Today I noticed that this section needs a massive update to include how well we were doing in 2014. We closed 2014 with 450,000 visitors on average and whooping 900,000 pageviews a month. Our themes have been downloaded over 600,000 times. We have come a long way and there is no sign of slowing down and we think that we have just started our journey.

            We are looking to contribute to the WordPress community by releasing free WordPress themes but you can expect premium features and premium themes as well.

            This project is entirely run by one person but currently, Colorlib is seeking someone who could make this website even more useful for the WordPress community.

            If you are interested in doing business with us, please contact us.</code>

            <code className="text-light mt-5">Millions of pageviews a month, tons of new themes and templates are added on daily basis and we have just started.

            It wasnâ€™t a serious business until around 2017 but now the organization has changed significantly and more great things to come in the following years decades to come.</code>
