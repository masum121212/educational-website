            </h1>
            <p>This website serves around 300,000 page views each month and most of the traffic comes from the US, UK, Australia, Japan, and Germany. Our themes are downloaded over 200,000 in less than one year and hopefully, we can double this number by end of 2014 (hopefully we will remember to update this number when the time comes).</p>
